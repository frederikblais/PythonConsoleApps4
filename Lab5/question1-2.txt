Question 1:
    a.  You can change a data value in a tuple but not in a
        list. True or False? Explain your answer.
        - False, its the opposite.

    b.  What is a comprehension list?
        - List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.
        ex: 
        fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
        newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]
        print(newlist)

    c.  How do you specify a step amount in a tuple slice?
        - the last value in the tuple[] is the step value
        ex:
        tuple = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
        s_tuple = tuple[0:6:2] # will jump by 3

    d.  What function creates a list from a tuple value?
        - list()

    e.  What index value retrieves the first value in a list?
        - [0]

    f.  What function do you use to remove a value from
        the middle of a list?
        - pop()

    g.  What function do you use to add a new data value 
        to the end of a list?
        - append()

Question 2:
    a.  A dictionary key can have one or more values
        associated with it at the same time. True or False? 
        Explain your answer.
        - False, Dictionary keys must belong to only one value (no duplicate keys allowed)

    b.  List three properties of a Dictionary key
        1) The key must be an immutable object (Cannot change)
        2) The key cannot be a list
        3) The key can be a tuple

    c.  A setâ€™s elements are mutable and can be changed. 
        True or False? Explain your answer.
        - True, howerver you can't change individual elements, you can only perform mass addition

    e.  Which set operation would you perform if you 
        wanted a set that contains only member that are in 
        two distinct sets?
        - .intersection()
